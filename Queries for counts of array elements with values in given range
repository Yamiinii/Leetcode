The code you provided is a C++ program that performs the following tasks:

It defines two functions, findLowerIndex and findUpperIndex, to find the lower and upper bounds of a range in a sorted array using binary search.

It defines a function countElementsInRange that calculates the number of elements in a given range in a sorted array by calling the findLowerIndex and findUpperIndex functions.

In the main function, it initializes an array arr and sorts it in ascending order.

It then calls the countElementsInRange function twice:

First, it calculates the number of elements in the range [1, 4].
Second, it calculates the number of elements in the range [9, 12].
Finally, it prints the results to the standard output.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code execution:

findLowerIndex and findUpperIndex functions use binary search to find the lower and upper bounds of a range in a sorted array. These functions return indices that help determine the count of elements within a given range.

In the main function:

The arr array is initialized with values {1, 4, 4, 9, 10, 3} and is sorted in ascending order using the sort function.
It calculates the count of elements in the range [1, 4] and prints the result, which is 3 (elements 1, 3, and 4 fall within this range).
It calculates the count of elements in the range [9, 12] and prints the result, which is 2 (elements 9 and 10 fall within this range).
So, the program correctly counts the elements within the specified ranges in the sorted array arr and prints the results accordingly.

Certainly, let me explain the findLowerIndex and findUpperIndex functions in more detail.

findLowerIndex Function:

This function is designed to find the lower bound of a specified value within a sorted array. The lower bound is the index of the first occurrence of a value greater than or equal to the given target value.

Here's how it works:

Input Parameters:

arr: The sorted array in which we want to find the lower bound.
n: The size of the array.
x: The target value for which we want to find the lower bound.
Binary Search Algorithm:

The function uses a binary search algorithm to efficiently locate the lower bound.
It maintains two pointers, low and high, initialized to the first and last indices of the array, respectively.
In each iteration of the while loop, it calculates the middle index mid as the average of low and high.
If the value at arr[mid] is greater than or equal to the target x, it means that the lower bound must be to the left of or at index mid. So, it updates high to mid - 1.
If the value at arr[mid] is less than x, it means that the lower bound must be to the right of mid. So, it updates low to mid + 1.
Returning the Result:

The function continues this process until low becomes greater than high, at which point it returns the value of low.
The value of low will be the index of the first occurrence of a value greater than or equal to x, which is the lower bound.
findUpperIndex Function:

This function is similar to findLowerIndex, but it finds the upper bound of a specified value within a sorted array. The upper bound is the index of the last occurrence of a value less than or equal to the given target value.

Here's how it works:

Input Parameters:

arr: The sorted array in which we want to find the upper bound.
n: The size of the array.
y: The target value for which we want to find the upper bound.
Binary Search Algorithm:

Similar to findLowerIndex, this function also uses a binary search algorithm.
It maintains two pointers, low and high, initialized to the first and last indices of the array, respectively.
In each iteration of the while loop, it calculates the middle index mid as the average of low and high.
If the value at arr[mid] is less than or equal to the target y, it means that the upper bound must be to the right of or at index mid. So, it updates low to mid + 1.
If the value at arr[mid] is greater than y, it means that the upper bound must be to the left of mid. So, it updates high to mid - 1.
Returning the Result:

The function continues this process until low becomes greater than high, at which point it returns the value of high.
The value of high will be the index of the last occurrence of a value less than or equal to y, which is the upper bound.
In summary, both functions use binary search to efficiently find the lower and upper bounds of a target value in a sorted array. These bounds are useful for determining the count of elements within a specified range.
